	<h2>Introducton</h2>
	<p>
		Exoplanets are defined as any planet orbiting a star outside of our own solar system. NASA in conjunction with Cal-Tech University monitors
		all the confirmed exoplanets that have been recorded and they make that information available to the public. There are 3431 planets currently
		in their confirmed database and it is this data that we have analyzed  in order to glean some important insights about what earth like planets
		might be out there waiting to be discovered.	
	</p>

	<img src="images/DatesVMethod.png" border="0">
	<p>
		As you can see on the graph above the rate that exoplanets are being discovered has been increasing in over time. It makes sense that as
		technology advances discovery comes more steadily and with an increased speed. With each new discovery comes opportunity.

	   <h4>Explanation:</h4>
	<p> The data above shows various important Discovery information such as what site and instrument was used to locate the planet and how our techniques for 
	identifying new planets have evolved over time. The data shows a massive spike of publications in 2014 suggesting that there may have been some other factors
	contributing to an increase in publications during that time period. Even excluding the outliers in 2014 you can see a positive trend with discovery data. More planets
	are being discovered on average and more techniques are being used to make these discoveries. </p>

	<h4>Explanation:</h4>
	<p> This data relates exoplanets to Earth using three main factors. The radius, mass, and atmospheric conditions. Without a relatively close comparison to earth
	in these catagories the chances of being able to support life is very poor. We can't make very acurate predictions about how Earth like most planets are just because
	we don't know enough about them. Planets in our own solar system are still far from being completely explored.</p>

	<h4>Explanation:</h4>
	<p> This shows exoplanets as discovered by year in a timeline format. You can see that as time goes on there are more planets being discovered
	however each new planet being discovered is no more likely to be Earth like than any of our older planets.</p>

<div id="proposal">	
	<h2>Full Project Proposal</h2>
	<p>
	  To display that data can be gathered over a variety of mediums and topics we have chosen to look at data pertaining to the various documented
	  exoplanets, or planets that have been discovered outside of our solar system. Scientists document and study these planets as a way to gain
	  insight into our own solar system and to better understand what’s beyond our own solar system. Finding a variety of other planets in different 
	  stages of their being allow us to more accurately predict what will happen to Earth in the future but there are plenty of other interesting insights
	  to be gained by studying exoplanets.
	</p>
	<p>For our analysis of the data we will look at the names and attributes of each planet, such as their discovery date, distance from earth, mass, and so on.
	We also plan to analyze the relationships between different exoplanets to see what connections can be drawn between varying planet attributes. Categories
	will be developed and analyzed based on these and other attributes. </p>

	<p>
	  Data on the planets themselves will be gathered from Exoplanets.org and NASA's confirmed exoplanet archive from Caltech University which includes 
	  thousands of documented exoplanets. Though there are multiple data sets available we believe it won’t be difficult to include data from multiple sources.
	  Both sources include data about the same planets they just focus on different attributes so we will essentially be combining both data sets without the 
	  overlap. Obviously it will take too long to gather data on all of these planets manually so the plan will be to gather a sufficient number of planets to 
	  draw conclusions from the known data. The sources for this data include planet names, overviews, bibliography, stellar information, and associated data. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  The following are questions that we look to answer by looking at and interpreting this data. What sort of correlations can be drawn between the method
	  of discovery and the physical attributes of an exoplanet? What is the historical trend of the discovery of exoplanets? Are we discovering new planets at
	  a consistent rate or is it perhaps increasing as technology advances? What can we learn about the exoplanets after discovering them? Are potential temperate
	  counter-parts (like Earth) becoming more common? What are the odds of the next exoplanet discovered to potentially have liquid water on its surface? How many 
	  exoplanets are or were once similar enough to earth for us to draw useful conclusions about our home? All of these questions can be explored using the exoplanet
	  data sets.

<div id="conclusion">
	<h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>There are way too many variables involved to definitively say if ANY planet outside our solar system could support life</li>
	  <li>The volume of exoplanets being discovered will continue to rise at an increasing rate as technology aides in the discovery process</li>
	  <li>Of the planets we already know about there is a very small likelihood that any of them fall into a real goldilocks zone 
		capable of supporting life as we know it on Earth.</li>
		<li>However even though there's a small chance most of our data is not verifiable and anything can happen.</li>
	</ul>
