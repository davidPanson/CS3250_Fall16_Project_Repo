<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	To display that data can
be gathered over a variety of mediums and topics we have chosen to
look at data pertaining to the various documented exoplanets, or
planets that have been discovered outside of our solar system.  Data
will be include the names and attributes of each planet, such as
their discovery date, distance from earth, mass, and so on. 
Categories will be developed and analyzed based on these and other
attributes.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	Data on the planets
themselves will be gathered from Exoplanets.org and NASA's confirmed
exoplanet archive from Caltech University which includes thousands of
documented exoplanets.  Obviously it will take too long to gather
data on all of these planets so the plan will be to gather a
sufficient number of planets to draw conclusions from the data.  The
sources for this data include planet names,  overviews, bibliography,
stellar information, and associated data.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>	The following are
questions that we look to answer by looking at and interpreting this
data.  What sort of correlations can be drawn between the method of
discovery and the physical attributes of an exoplanet?  What is the
historical trend of the discovery of exoplanets?  What can we learn
about them after discovering them?  Are potential temperate
counter-parts (like Earth) becoming more common?  What are the odds
of the next exoplanet discovered to potentially have liquid water on
its surface?  </FONT>
